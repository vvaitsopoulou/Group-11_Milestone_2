		//to call repopulate allFlights hashmap method every time a new regular direct flight is added to the weeklyFlights Hashmap to
		//simulate a real life scenario when a new route is added to the model between two previously unconnected airports after the system has been initialised, and the
		// flights occuring from the current day forward should be updated. However,
		//because in our model the addition of flights both at the beginning and in this scenario happen with the same method, modifying the above
		//method would add computational overhead at the start, thus the thought was discarded. In the current model this operation mainly serves the purpose of
		//'refreshing' the alllfights hashmap every few months based on our model, so that flights conducted on past dates are no longer stored
